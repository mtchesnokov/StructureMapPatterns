# Introduction

The purpose of this repository to present (and also experiment with) some handy code samples (code designs) that may applied in day-to-day development. Each of those samples may help tackle 3 important goals in 
software development: 

  * [Minimize code footprint i.e. minimize effort when wrting new functionality](#availableconversions)
  * [Ensure that the selected approach offers sufficient extensibility to match changing needs](#convertingdocumentblob)
  * [Ensure that the code is testable](#convertingdocumentusingcontenturl)
