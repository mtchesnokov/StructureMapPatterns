# Introduction

The purpose of this repository is to present/experiment with some code patterns each addressing one of the software problems occurring in daily development. Each of the patterns is written as a separate 'life-ready' project that can be easily converted to production code. 

The purpose of each of those patterns is to try to achieve the following 3 important goals: 

  * [Solve the problem with minimum code](#lesscode)
  * [Ensure that the implementation is extensible and ready for changes](#flexible)
  * [Ensure that the implentation is testable is robust](#testible)

Alle the examples presented here extensively use SOLID principle with StructureMap as the DI Container of choice. With small modifications the patterns can be adjusted to work with other DI container implementations. 

The repo contains at the moment the following patterns:

* <a href='https://github.com/mtchesnokov/CodePatterns/blob/master/ObjectQuery/README.md'>Object query pattern</a>
* <a href='https://github.com/mtchesnokov/CodePatterns/blob/master/ObjectExtender/README.md'>Object extender pattern</a>
